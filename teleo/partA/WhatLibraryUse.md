<h2>How would you technically implement a screenshot image</h2>

I should consider implementing my solution using https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/.

*Pros:*
    -   The library is compatible with React and TypeScript.
    -   The community has had a better experience with it compared to other libraries such as https://github.com/html-screen-capture-js and react-screen-capture.
    -   It is easier to implement and allows for quick result comparison.
    -   Compatible with most browsers, including Firefox 3.5+, Google Chrome, Opera 12+, IE9+, and Safari 6+.
    -   The community can customize the style and branding.
    -   The library is open source.

*Cons:*
    -   The last update was made 2 years ago.
    -   There are some open issues that need to be addressed.
